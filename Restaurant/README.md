### Make a class called restaurant.
The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.<br />
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.<br />
Make an instance called restaurant from class. Print two attributes individually, and then call both methods.

Create three different instances from the classes, and call describe_restaurant() for each instance.
